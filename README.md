# Kanban Project

This project is a Kanban-style application where users can define custom
categories and manage tasks. Users can drag and drop tasks and subtasks to
organize them within and across categories. The project is built with **Next.js
v15**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Drizzle ORM**.

## Features

- User-defined categories.
- Tasks and subtasks can be reordered within categories and moved across
  categories using drag-and-drop.
- Real-time updates to the database when tasks and subtasks are moved.
- Built with the latest **Next.js v15** for the most up-to-date features.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js v15**: For managing frontend and server-side functionalities.

- **PostgreSQL**: To store task and category data.
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database interactions.
